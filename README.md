# Project Armitage


## Overview



_Armitage_ (an internal project name, game title TBD) is a turn-based combat prototype that blends card play and dice mechanics. Each combatant alternates turns, spending Action Points (AP) to play cards that perform attacks or utility actions. Dice rolls determine combat outcomes.



The system is deterministic in structure but probabilistic in outcome: all randomization is driven by six-sided dice (D6).



One-versus-one, and party-versus-party encounter modes are both supported.
